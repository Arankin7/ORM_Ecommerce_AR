  ## Description 
  This project was to create a backend server for an E-Commerce site.

  ## Installation
  The repository should be cloned.  The following NPM packages must be installed: Mysql2, Express, dotenv, and Sequelize.  Make sure to create an environment variable file with your MySQL username, password, and the database name.  

  ## Testing
  To test the server you must first seed the database. To run the seeds, open the console and run 'npm run seed'.  Then to start the server run 'npm start' in the command line.

  ## Demo
  Here is a demo of all CRUD operations.  First I use the GET routes for the Categories, Products, and Tags.  After POSTing a new Category, Product, and Tag, I then show that the categories, products, and tags can be queried by ID.  I proceed to use the PUT routes to update the newly created seeds. (I accidently had the tagIds entered wrong, but fixed it during the video)  Finally I use the DELETE routes to delete the new seeds that were just created.
